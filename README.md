# Suspension Simulation
in this python3 project, this aims to emulate the application of using python in an engineering context.

Provided a mathematical suspension model, I was tasked in this assignment to encode the model to build a simple decleration 
simulation of a car suspension, and then build code on top of that to calculate a discomfort metric baesd on
the assignment spec.

The project was intended to translate an ordinary differential equation into python utilising the numpy module
to perform data analysis and extrapolation.
