# Suspension Simulation
In this python3 project, this aims to emulate the application of using python in an engineering context. It was one of my first ever code courses which made me switch to SWE.

Provided a mathematical suspension model, I was tasked in this assignment to encode the model to build a simple decleration 
simulation of a car suspension, and then build code on top of that to calculate a discomfort metric baesd on
the assignment spec.

The project was intended to translate an ordinary differential equation into python utilising the numpy module
to perform data analysis and extrapolation.

All test files were initially built by the course convener, and with their permission we were able to build our own test cases on top of theirs.
